## Documentation for PyPDF2 library for PDF operations:
[PyPDF2](https://pypdf2.readthedocs.io/en/3.x/) : PyPDF2 is a free and open-source pure-python PDF library capable of splitting, merging, cropping, and transforming the pages of PDF files. It can also add custom data, viewing options, and passwords to PDF files. PyPDF2 can retrieve text and metadata from PDFs as well.

## Documentation for PIL library for Image Processing:
[PIL](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): The Python Imaging Library adds image processing capabilities to your Python interpreter. This library provides extensive file format support, an efficient internal representation, and fairly powerful image processing capabilities.

## Documentation for smtplib and email for Email Processing:
[smtplib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html) : The smtplib module defines an SMTP client session object that can be used to send mail to any internet machine with an SMTP or ESMTP listener daemon. For details of SMTP and ESMTP operation, consult RFC 821 (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) and RFC 1869 (SMTP Service Extensions).

[email](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.html) : The email package is a library for managing email messages. It is specifically not designed to do any sending of email messages to SMTP (RFC 2821), NNTP, or other servers; those are functions of modules such as smtplib and nntplib.
